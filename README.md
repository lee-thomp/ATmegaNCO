### ATmegaNCO ###

This is an attempt to create a synthesiser oscillator using an ATmega328p (or other AVR) microcontroller.
Development work is mainly targetting the Arduino Nano platform, but a bare chip should work with similar clocking and I/O.

This project uses [avr_debug](https://github.com/jdolinay/avr_debug) currently, but will likely be moved to a debug branch when functionality is proven.
